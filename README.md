# Split View

Open tabs in a native split view right in your browser

The extension has 3 layouts: 2 frames horizontal, 3 frames horizontal and 2 frames vertical.
You can resize each frames.

And even if it is not recommended, you can in fact mix and match those layouts by opening in one of the frames a tab where the extension is already running.

## Important security caveat

For this extension to work, it has to lower the security of your browser by allowing any website to be embedded in iframes.<br>
This is done by modifying headers on the fly. To be as secure as possible, this is only the case when the extension has some Split views open.
